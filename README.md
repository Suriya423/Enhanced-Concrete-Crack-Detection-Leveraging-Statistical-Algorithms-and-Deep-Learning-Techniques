# Towards-Autonomous-Road-Inspection-An-AI-Driven-Crack-Detection-Solution
Road Crack Detection using Deep Learning

The problem addressed by this project is the inefficiency and limitations of conventional road inspection methods, which heavily rely on human labor. These methods are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error, leading to potential safety hazards and inefficiencies in transportation infrastructure maintenance. 

This project aims to contribute a method for an AI-driven crack detection solution that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to autonomously detect and assess cracks in road surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. This solution seeks to revolutionize road maintenance practices by enabling faster, cost-effective, and more reliable inspections, ultimately contributing to the safety and longevity of transportation infrastructure.
